**Spotify's "Friends Playlist"** is a concept feature, on Apple CarPlay, that auto generates playlists based on a mix containing songs from the public libraries of friends that are physically close to you.

After spending a few hours exploring Spotify on Apple Carplay inside a 2017 Volkswagen Polo **we encountered limitations that were resulting in constant distraction for the driver** while driving that are multiplied when driving with friends when trying to change songs.  
**We envisioned a new feature for apple carplay** and mobile that **generates a playlist** based on a mix containing songs from the **public libraries of friends that are physically close to you**, that will listen to music in the same event.

This reduces interactions and distractions inside the car, avoiding accidents and promotes safe driving on car dashboard whenever risky behaviour occurs.
