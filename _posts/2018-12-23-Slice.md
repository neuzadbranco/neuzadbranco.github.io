As a student of the 2018–2019 “Digital Experience Design” Post Graduation at Faculty of Belas-Artes of University of Lisbon, we were asked to create a web app and design the whole process.

When I played tennis I was limited to the practices. The only people i knew outside the school only played for fun. That’s why I decided to create this application that can help us practice more and level up our skills on tennis or padel.​​​​​​​
