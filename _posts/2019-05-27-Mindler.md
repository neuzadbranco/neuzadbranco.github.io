**Dementia** can make it difficult to learn new things, **consistent routines can be calming and reassuring, for both the person with dementia and those around her.**  
**Mindler** is a digital product that aims to help people who take care of patients diagnosed with dementia creating a healthy and balanced routine.

In order to start using the app, the user's first task is to add a patient. In this step, important information such as **medication** and **emergency contacts** are set up.  
On **statistics and planning**, the caretaker can keep an eye on every missed task with the statistics feature. **Planning** let's you organize the future events and sync them with the current routine.

On the dashboard, the patient has the option to **check the current task** or see his upcoming tasks. He also has an easy access shortcut to check daily medication and events planned ahead.  
Knowing that routines are the most important factor on helping patients diagnosed with dementia, there's an area where he can **take a look at his basic daily tasks.**

If something goes wrong, the patient has a "Help" section where he is able to ask simple questions or make emergency calls.
