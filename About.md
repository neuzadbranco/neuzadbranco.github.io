Hello!<br><br>I'm Neuza Branco, a 23 years old digital designer based in Lisbon.<br>Since I was a little girl, I had this passion on illustration and art. Soon enough, I kept a place for design in my heart.<br><br>Traveling, exploring and working in a creative environment with unique people are the main things that inspires, motivates and helps me grow as a designer.<br><br>Let's create together! :)
